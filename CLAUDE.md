# Universal Prompt Creation Engine

## Project Overview

An MCP server that provides a 10-dimensional philosophical manifold for principled prompt construction. Built on a Construct of 10 planes — each a 10x10 grid of epistemic observation points — interconnected through nexi, gems, and spokes. Implemented with NetworkX (graph compute) + numpy (linear algebra) + SQLite (persistence) + Python MCP SDK (protocol).

The engine does not generate prompts. It measures intent across 10 philosophical axes and returns a construction basis from which the client constructs.

## Architecture

- **Construct**: 10 planes (branches), each a 10x10 grid of 100 observation points with position-determined classification and potency. See `docs/CONSTRUCT.md`.
- **3-Level Schema**: Axiom Layer (10 branches with 2 sub-dimensions each) → Schema Layer (10x10 grids, 100 constructs per branch, 1000 total) → Coordinate Layer (computed (x,y) positions)
- **Inter-Branch**: 90 directional nexi producing 90 gems, organized as 10 spokes converging on a central gem. Dual view: network (pair-level) and radial (branch-level).
- **External Surface**: 3 MCP tools (`create_prompt_basis`, `explore_space`, `extend_schema`) + 4 prompts + 3 resources
- **Internal Layers** (top to bottom):
  1. Multi-Pass Orchestrator (stress_test, triangulate, deepen)
  2. Pipeline (8 stages — single forward pass)
  3. Graph Query Layer + Graph Mutation Layer (structured graph access)
  4. Embedding Cache + TF-IDF Cache (lifecycle-managed, auto-invalidate on graph mutation)
  5. NetworkX (compute, 1101 nodes, ~1479 edges) + SQLite (persist, canonical/user tables)

## Conventions

- Each class in its own file
- Pipeline stages are internal — never exposed as MCP tools
- All graph access goes through Graph Query Layer or Graph Mutation Layer — no direct NetworkX calls elsewhere
- Canonical graph data is read-only at the DB level (SQLite triggers)
- Canonical node IDs are permanent across versions (format: `branch.x_y` for constructs, `nexus.source.target` for nexi)
- User extensions use provenance tagging, never modify canonical tables
- Caches (embedding, TF-IDF) are lifecycle-managed: computed at startup, invalidated on graph mutation, recomputed lazily
- Mathematical operations live in `math/` module, imported by pipeline stages and caches
- Grid structure logic (classification, potency derivation, spectrum generation) lives in `graph/grid.py`
- Nexus, gem, and spoke computations are separate math modules (`math/gem.py`, `math/spoke.py`)
- Potency weighting is applied in tension, gem, and spoke computations — never ignored
- Use `print()` during development for debugging, remove when stable
- Contradiction detection lives in Graph Mutation Layer, not in individual tools
- The Construct specification (`docs/CONSTRUCT.md`) is the source of truth for what planes, points, spectrums, nexi, gems, spokes, and the central gem ARE — use engine-specific language only in engine code, not in the Construct spec

## Key Terminology

| Term | Definition |
|---|---|
| Plane | A domain of meaning — maps to an axiom branch |
| Point | A specific possibility of observation — maps to a Level 2 construct at grid position (x,y) |
| Spectrum | A structured opposition between two edge points — auto-generated from grid geometry |
| Nexus | A mediating locus between two branches — a place of interaction with its own identity |
| Gem | The condensed state of a nexus interaction — a resolved expression, storable and reusable |
| Spoke | The complete set of a branch's interactions with all other branches — a behavioral signature |
| Central Gem | The unified convergence of all nexus interactions — system-wide synthesis |
| Potency | Position-derived weight: corner=1.0, midpoint=0.95, edge=0.85, center=0.5 |
